## Accessibility

To ensure that usage of this component complies with accessibility guidelines:

- Text container does not exceed 634px or line length does not exceed more than 75 characters
- Minimize use of reversed-out body copy because it’s harder to read 
- When possible, use the first sentence as an introduction to the paragraph. With screen readers, users can listen to the first sentence and then jump to the next paragraph 
- Break long pages into shorter sections by organizing content into well-defined groups or chunks

<br/>

This component has compliance with following WebAIM’s accessibility guidelines:
- [WCAG SC 1.4.8: Visual presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation): Cedar Design System text component provides for spacing for: 
  - Within paragraphs, line spacing is at least 1.5 times font height
  - Between paragraphs, at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing

## Use when

- Displaying articles for long-form content, such as Expert Advice articles or Co-op Journal entries
- Displaying member or legal messages, such as on PDP pages
- Displaying product descriptions
- Displaying customer reviews, such as on PDP pages

### Don’t use when

- Displaying form inputs. Instead, use Inputs
- Displaying alert messages. Instead, use Alerts
- Listing product features. Instead, use [Lists](../lists/)

- Legal messages on PDP pages
- Shipping messages on PDP pages
- Customer reviews on PDP pages
- Class or event descriptions

## Content

- Use adjacent text, a definition list, a glossary, or other method to supplement words that are ambiguous
- Abbreviations:
  - Follow [REI Copy Guidelines](http://pcempub.rei.com/content/asset-guides/en_us/site/brand-assets-guides/copy/master-brand-copy-guides.html) for dates, time, dimensions, measurements, electrical units, and geographic reference
  - Expand abbreviations by explaining the definition the first time it is used
  - Use the `<abbr>` element, or link to a definition or glossary
- Readability level on Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level should be roughly 9 years of primary education. For more information, view [Test your document’s readability](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Test-your-document-s-readability-85b4969e-e80a-4777-8dd3-f7fc3c8b3fd2) on Microsoft’s website
- When possible, write the first sentence as an introduction to the paragraph. With screen readers, users can jump from paragraph to paragraph, listening to the first sentence or two before moving on to the next paragraph

## Installation

Resources are available within the [CdrText package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rei/cdr-text)

- Component: `@rei/cdr-text`

<br />

To incorporate the required assets for a component, use the following steps:

### 1. Install using NPM 

Install the Cdr-Text package using `npm` in your terminal:

_Terminal_

```bash
npm i -S @rei/cdr-text
```

### 2. Import dependencies

_main.js_

```javascript
// import your required CSS.
import "@rei/cdr-assets/dist/cdr-core.css";
import "@rei/cdr-assets/dist/cdr-fonts.css";
```

### 3. Add component to a template

_local.vue_

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-text
    modifier="body"
  >
    For long-form content like expert advice articles or co-op journal entries.
  </cdr-text>
</template>

<script>
import { CdrText } from '@rei/cdr-text';
export default {
  ...
  components: {
     CdrText  
  }
}
</script>
```

## Usage

The CdrText component allows for styling any html element with available text styles. Visual style and semantic meaning are managed independently by providing: 

* Element to the `tag` prop 
* Style to the `modifier` prop

<br />

By default the cdrText component renders as a paragraph, this default paragraph is intended for most standard use cases.

```vue
  <cdr-text>
    This is a standard paragraph, intended for non long form copy usage.
  </cdr-text>
```

When rendering long form copy add the `body` modifier.

```vue
  <cdr-text modifier="body">
    This paragraph is intended for long form copy usage.  
  </cdr-text>
```

Define custom tags by applying a specific `cdr-text` style with modifiers to it.

```vue
  <cdr-text
    tag="span"
    modifier="body">
    This span now renders as a long form copy paragraph that displays inline.
  </cdr-text>
```

</cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>
</template>

<template slot="History">
