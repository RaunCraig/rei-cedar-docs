## Compact

Reduced spacing around title and content body. Also, smaller font sizes resulting in an overall denser display of content.

## Border Aligned

## Accessibility

To ensure that usage of this component complies with accessibility guidelines:
- Provide descriptive label for accordion header
- Be aware that embedding lengthy content in an accordion can be disorienting. When the accordion header expands, it can give the appearance of moving to another page

<br />

This component has compliance with WCAG guidelines by:
- Providing keyboard interactions to:
  - Expand and collapse accordion headers
  - Navigate and reverse navigate through the accordion headers
- Generating ARIA tags for accessibility, specifically `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-hidden`

</cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>
</template>

<template slot="Design Guidelines">
<cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>

## Use when

- Providing users more content within the same layout
- Displaying content that's directly related, or supplemental, to the main subject of the page
- Designing with limited vertical space and there is enough content to condense

### Don't use when

- Linking a title to another page. Instead, use [Links](../links/)
- Designing with sparse content. Instead, use [Lists](../lists/) or [Paragraphs](../paragraphs/)
- Content is lengthy. Instead, use [Tabs](../tabs/)

## Foundations

- Always include a title, icon and subsequent content for each section. All are required
- Use on either light or dark backgrounds, background color is provided for both
- Never nest accordions within themselves

## Content

- Order the accordion titles by priority and importance
- Keep titles short to avoid wrapping at smaller viewports
- Use sentence case for titles

## Behavior

- Entire title area is clickable, including icon and background.
- Accordion sections are all closed by default, however it is possible to:
  - Open all accordion sections when page is displayed
  - Open a single accordion section with remaining accordion section closed
- Multiple sections can be open at the same time
- Sections do not automatically collapse when another is expanded
- Position interactive elements (i.e. Select, Button, Link) within the container far enough from the title area to avoid accidental collapsing
- Never nest accordions within themselves
- Use short titles for accordion labels to avoid wrapping

### Do / Don't

<do-dont :examples="$page.frontmatter.nesting" />

<br />

<do-dont :examples="$page.frontmatter.titles" />

## Responsiveness

- Accordion style can change variant based on breakpoint. Example: _Default_ at MD/LG, _Compact_ and _Border-Aligned_ at XS/SM
- Switching between tab component and accordion component is not supported in Cedar components library. Do not replace the accordion component with the tab component at different breakpoints

</cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>
</template>

<template slot="API">
<cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>

Accordions are built from two components, CdrAccordion and CdrAccordionItem, which are meant to be used together.

## Props

### CdrAccordion
<cdr-doc-api type="prop" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[0].api.props" />

### CdrAccordionItem
<cdr-doc-api type="prop" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[1].api.props" />

## Slots

Find more information about using Slots in the article, <cdr-link :href="$withBase('/getting-started/as-a-developer/?active-link=add-content-via-slots')">Getting Started as a Developer</cdr-link>

### CdrAccordion
<cdr-doc-api type="slot" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[0].api.slots" :slots-getting-started-link="false" />

### CdrAccordionItem
<cdr-doc-api type="slot" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[1].api.slots" :slots-getting-started-link="false" />

## Events

### CdrAccordionItem
<cdr-doc-api type="event" :api-data="$page.frontmatter.versions[0].components[1].api.events" />

## Installation

Resources are available within the [CdrAccordion package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rei/cdr-accordion):

<cdr-doc-api type="installation" />

- Component: `@rei/cdr-accordion`
- Component styles: `cdr-accordion.css`

<br />

To incorporate the required assets for a component, use the following steps:

### 1. Install using NPM

Install the **CdrAccordion** package using `npm` in your terminal:

_Terminal_

```bash
npm i -s @rei/cdr-accordion
```

### 2. Import Dependencies

_main.js_

```javascript
// import your required CSS
import "@rei/cdr-accordion/dist/cdr-accordion.css";
```

### 3. Add component to a template

_local.vue_

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-accordion>
    <cdr-accordion-item
      id="default-example"
      label="This is the label text"
    >
      This is the accordion content.
    </cdr-accordion-item>
  </cdr-accordion>
</template>

<script>
  import { CdrAccordion, CdrAccordionItem } from "@rei/cdr-accordion";

  export default {
    ...
    components: {
      CdrAccordion,
      CdrAccordionItem
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Usage

### Style

Use `cdr-accordion` to pass styling options to `cdr-accordion-item`.

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-accordion
    :compact="true"
  >
    <cdr-accordion-item
      id="item-1"
      label="Label text"
    >
      Accordion content here
    </cdr-accordion-item>
  </cdr-accordion>
</template>
```

### Behavior

Set `show-all` to `true` on `cdr-accordion`, and each `cdr-accordion-item` will display in an open state.

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-accordion
    :show-all="true"
  >
    <cdr-accordion-item
      id="item-1"
      label="Label text"
    >
      Accordion content here
    ...
```

The **CdrAccordionItem** component can also be controlled individually. If `show-all` is `false` at the **CdrAccordion** level, set `show` to `true` to display an individual accordion item in an open state. Note that **CdrAccordion** settings will take precedence over **CdrAccordionItem** settings.

```vue
<template>
  <cdr-accordion>
    <cdr-accordion-item
      id="item-1"
      label="Label text"
      :show="true"
    >
      Accordion content here
    ...
```

Any options set at the **CdrAccordion level** can be set on any parent component of **CdrAccordion** by using Vue's provide/inject functionality. This is useful, for instance, if **CdrAccordionItem** ever needs to be used as a part of another group component.


```vue
<template>
  ...
  <cdr-accordion-item
    id="item-1"
    label="Label text"
  >
    Accordion content here
  </cdr-accordion-item>
  ...
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    ...
    provide() {
      return {
        borderAligned: true,
        showAll: true
      };
    }
  }
</script>
```

</cdr-doc-table-of-contents-shell>
</template>
